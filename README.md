# PREDICTION-OF-INSURANCE-PREMIUM
# The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that can predict insurance premiums for customers based on various factors such as age, gender, occupation, and medical history. Insurance premiums are the amount of money customers pay to an insurance company to receive coverage for various risks, such as health or property damage.
